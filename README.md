# Efficient Forex Robot

Efficient Forex Robot is an autonomous and secure trading solution developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This Expert Advisor (EA) is designed to analyze the market and make informed trading decisions based on the analysis. It can be used on multiple currency pairs simultaneously, including CADJPY, GBPCHF, AUDJPY, and a symbol represented by 'U' (please provide clarification for this symbol).

## Installation
To use Efficient Forex Robot, follow these steps:
1. Copy the `Efficient.mq5` file into the 'MQL5/Experts' folder of your MetaTrader 5 platform.
2. Restart MetaTrader 5.
3. Open the MetaEditor and compile the `Efficient.mq5` file.
4. Attach the EA to a chart of the desired symbol and timeframe.

## Input Parameters
The EA allows you to customize the following input parameters:
- Symbol1: The first currency pair symbol to analyze (default: CADJPY).
- Symbol2: The second currency pair symbol to analyze (default: GBPCHF).
- Symbol3: The third currency pair symbol to analyze (default: AUDJPY).
- Symbol4: The fourth currency pair symbol to analyze (default: U). Please provide clarification for this symbol.

## How it Works
Efficient Forex Robot utilizes the Trade library, which is included in the code, to handle trading operations. The EA performs market analysis for each specified symbol by calling the `AnalyzeMarket` function. Inside this function, you can place your custom analysis code to determine trading opportunities based on the symbol's market data.

After analyzing the market, the EA calls the `MakeTradingDecisions` function to make informed trading decisions based on the analysis. You can customize this function to implement your decision-making logic.

Finally, the EA executes trades by calling the `ExecuteTrades` function. Inside this function, you can place your trade execution code to open, modify, or close positions based on the trading decisions made.

The EA continuously repeats this process in the `OnTick` function, which is called on each new tick received. The `OnStart` function is responsible for the main expert logic, where the `OnTick` function is executed in a loop until the EA is stopped.
